# Android
All that I have played with Android

GO TO:
1. Applications for some cool apps
2. Animations has some demo for commonly used Animations
3. Architectures demonstrates architectural styles and best practices, commonly used Libraries, etc

For all the apps, just fork or download the repo, clean & rebuild the project, and you are good to go!

Thanks.
